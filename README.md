A technical assignment to build a housing advertisment page.

## How to run

This Flutter project can be run on any emulator or physical device with the following command:

```flutter run```

However, it is advised to run it on a device with a screen resolution of 1080x2340, as device size responsiveness was left out of scope for this assignment.

## Test

There is a unit test to check the serialization of the House-model. To run this test, run the following command from the root of the project:

```flutter test```
